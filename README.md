- also worth mentioning post processing i remove the supports carefully then scrape what i can with an xacto or hobby knife, then and this could be the most important part i use a BUTANE torch to burn away any leftover bits and strings QUICKLY and because its butane it gets REAL hot REAL quick but not for a sustained amount of time so it smooths the exterior a bit without warping any of the actual print itself.

the .orca_printer file is the whole set to be uploaded to orca


below are some examples of my results. this may get updated over time
